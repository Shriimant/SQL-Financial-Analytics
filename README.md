# Problem Statement
Croma India needs a monthly aggregated sales report at the product code level for FY 2021 to track individual product sales and enable further product analytics in Excel. The report should include key metrics such as Month, Product Name, Variant, Sold Quantity, Gross Price Per Item, and Gross Price Total to help analyze sales trends, optimize strategies, and improve decision-making.

To derive these insights, various SQL techniques are applied.

**User-defined functions** in SQL are designed to perform specific tasks and return a result. They allow for reusable logic, making queries more modular, efficient, and easier to maintain.

SQL joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a requirement of the project.

Another step includes, developing a stored procedure to assign a market badge based on sales volumeâ€”markets with over 5 million units sold earn a Gold badge, otherwise they receive Silver. Input: Market & Fiscal Year | Output: Market Badge.
