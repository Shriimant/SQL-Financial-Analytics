# Problem Statement
Croma India needs a monthly aggregated sales report at the product code level for FY 2021 to track individual product sales and enable further product analytics in Excel. The report should include key metrics such as Month, Product Name, Variant, Sold Quantity, Gross Price Per Item, and Gross Price Total to help analyze sales trends, optimize strategies, and improve decision-making.

To derive these insights, various SQL techniques are applied.

**User-defined functions** in SQL are designed to perform specific tasks and return a result. They allow for reusable logic, making queries more modular, efficient, and easier to maintain.

**SQL joins** are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a requirement of the project.

Another step includes, developing a **stored procedure** to assign a market badge based on sales volume—markets with over 5 million units sold earn a Gold badge, otherwise they receive Silver. Input: Market & Fiscal Year | Output: Market Badge.

**This project helped me gain essential skills, such as -**

✅ Data Retrieval (Single Table):
Mastered essential SQL queries like SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIKE and numeric filters such as BETWEEN, IN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET. Also explored aggregations (MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY) & calculated columns using IF, CASE, YEAR, and CURYEAR.

✅ Data Retrieval (Multiple Tables):
Learned to analyze data across multiple tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and CROSS JOINS.

✅ Complex Queries:
Explored subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), views, and temporary tables for efficient data handling.

✅ Database Creation & Management:
Gained hands-on experience with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), database normalization, data integrity, primary/foreign keys and key operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

✅ ETL & Data Warehousing:
Learned Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, data warehousing, and the differences between OLAP and OLTP systems.

✅ Advanced SQL Techniques:
Built user-defined functions and stored procedures for query optimization. Also mastered window functions like OVER(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() for advanced data analysis.

✅ Real-World Experience:
Worked on a real dataset with over 1 million records and applied SQL in industry-focused projects on finance domain.
