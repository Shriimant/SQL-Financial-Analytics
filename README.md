# Problem Statement
Croma India needs a monthly aggregated sales report at the product code level for FY 2021 to track individual product sales and enable further product analytics in Excel. The report should include key metrics such as Month, Product Name, Variant, Sold Quantity, Gross Price Per Item, and Gross Price Total to help analyze sales trends, optimize strategies, and improve decision-making.

To derive these insights, various SQL techniques are applied.

**User-defined functions** in SQL are designed to perform specific tasks and return a result. They allow for reusable logic, making queries more modular, efficient, and easier to maintain.

**SQL joins** are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a requirement of the project.

Another step includes, developing a **stored procedure** to assign a market badge based on sales volumeâ€”markets with over 5 million units sold earn a Gold badge, otherwise they receive Silver. Input: Market & Fiscal Year | Output: Market Badge.

**This project helped me gain essential skills, such as -**

1. Mastered essential SQL queries like SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIKE and numeric filters such as BETWEEN, IN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET. Also explored aggregations (MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY) & calculated columns using IF, CASE, YEAR, and CURYEAR.

2. Learned to analyze data across multiple tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and CROSS JOINS.

3. Explored subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), views, and temporary tables for efficient data handling.

4. Gained hands-on experience with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), database normalization, data integrity, primary/foreign keys and key operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

5. Learned Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, data warehousing, and the differences between OLAP and OLTP systems.

6. Implemented Window function concepts like OVER(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() for advanced data analysis.

7. Worked on a real dataset with over 1 million records and applied SQL in industry-focused projects on finance domain.
